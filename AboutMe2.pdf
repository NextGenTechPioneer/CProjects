üß† About Me
With over a decade of experience in technology leadership, system design, and hands-on software development, I have contributed to critical enterprise solutions across domains including financial services,  education, and cloud infrastructure.

I‚Äôve served in pivotal roles across organizations, where I led architecture, delivery, and operations of scalable, secure, and high-performing systems.

üîí Note on Confidentiality
Due to the sensitive nature of my professional projects, I am unable to publicly share the source code or architecture artifacts for most of those implementations. 
These restrictions are in place to honor client confidentiality, legal obligations, and internal compliance policies.
